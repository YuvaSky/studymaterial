Array
-----
1)It is used to store similar type of data
2)It stores data int contiguous manner
3)Size of the array is fixed.It means it can neither grow not shrink

Remember data could be value as well as reference of objects
In java programming data will be kept into objects and refererence of these objects will be
kept into array


datatype [] name=new datatype[10];

Datatype could be primitive(int,byte,short,boolean,char,double,float,long) as well as non-primitive(class)

int [] num=new int[10];//In this array program will keep int type value
Product [] p=new Product[10];//In this array program will keep reference of Product class object

Reference of the array
----------------------
Every array in memory has an unique reference
JVM generates this reference and returns to the program
Program must keep this reference in a variable
Default value will be assigned to the array
