static keyword

We can use this keyword to declare/define static variables and static methods inside class

public class AA
{
  int num;//non-static or instance variable
  public void show() //non-static method
  {
	//code
  }
}

public class Bb
{
  static int num;//static variable or class variable
  public static void show() //static method
  {
	//code
  }
}

Static variable has only one copy in memory.It is created when class is loaded in memory
Object reference is not required to access/use this variable
