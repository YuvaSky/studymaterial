Types of exceptions
--------------------
There are two types of exceptions
1)Checked exceptions
2)Unchecked exceptions

Checked exceptions
------------------
Handling these exceptions are mandatory
Compiler checks existense of handler(try and catch) in source code of program
If not found then code will not be compiled
All child classes(Except RuntimeException) of Exception class are checked exceptions
Checked exceptions are also called compile time exceptions

Unchecked Exceptions
------------------
Handling these exceptions are not mandatory
Compiler does not checks existense of handler(try and catch) in source code of program
All child classes of RuntimeException are unchecked exceptions
Few child classes of RuntimeException are as follows
1)ArithmeticException 
2)NullPointerException
3)ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
4)ClassCastException
5)NumberFormatException
etc
Precaution of these exceptions are possible that's why handling these exceptions are not mandatory
These exceptions are also called run time exceptions
