Exception handling 
------------------
Following three activities are performed during exceptions handling
1)Creating exception
2)Throwing exception
3)Catching exception

Creating exception
------------------
JVM or APIs creates exception(An object) when any abnormal condition occurs during execution
In this object information about the exception is stored

Throwing exception
------------------
After creating exception, JVM or APIs throws that exception towards program(Reference of exception will be sent to the program)

Catching exception
------------------
Program has resposibility to catch exception(Accepting reference of the exception)
Program must have exception handler to accept exception
This hadler will be defined by programmer
Following two block should be defined by programmer to catch exception

1)Try block
try
{
  //Write code here(The code that can cause exception)
}

2)Catch block
catch(ExceptionException cls)
{
  //code to display exception message
}
