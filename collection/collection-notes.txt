Collection framework
--------------------

Group of objects is known as collection
Collection itself an object
Our program can create this object(collection) to keep references of multiple objects

Product p; //Only reference of single object can be kept

Product [] p=new Product[10];//Only reference of 10 objects can be kept

ArrayList<Product> list=new ArrayList<Product>();//Reference  of multiple objects can be kept

Remember collection can be homogeneous as well as hetergeneous

ArrayList list=new ArrayList();
