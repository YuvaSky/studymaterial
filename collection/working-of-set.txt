Set collection
--------------
Set is a child interface of Collection interface
It has all methods of Collection interface
Set collection has following features
1)It is unordered collection
2)It does not allow duplicacy of elements
3)It allows single null value

Set interfac has only one implementation class.Name of that class is HashSet

HashSet class
-------------
It is implementation of Set interface.
We can use this collection when our program does not want to keep dublicate elements inside collection
HashSet class uses instance/object of HashMap class to store elements 
HashMap uses Hashtable to keep elements inside it
Hashtable creates array of buckets to keep elements.Initial size of this array is 16 bydefault
It means Hashtable creates 16 buckets.
Bucket is nothing it is an object of doubly linked list
Remember each bucket will be identified by using array index number
So index of first bucket will be 0 and last will be 15

Hashtable calls following two methods of Object class internally

1)public int hashCode():This method is called by Hashtable to get index of bucket in which element is to be added

2)public boolean equals(Object obj):This method is called by Hashtable to avoid duplicacy of elements.This method will be called when same hashcode number element has already added into collection.It will be checked into same bucket
