Map collection
--------------
As we know list collection,set collection and queue collection are implementation of Collection interface.But map collection is not implementation of Collection interface
Map collection is implementation of Map interface
Map collection keeps element in key-value pair
Due to key, elements can be accessed easily
Map interface has only one implementation class
This class is HashMap
Remember HashSet uses instance/object of HashMap to keep elements
In HashMap, key will always be unique and value(It is mostly element) can be duplicate

HashMap<Integer,String> map=new HashMap<Integer,String>();

Key-value pair inside HashMap collection is unordered

LikedHashMap class
-------------------
It is a child of HashMap class
Key-value pair inside LinkedHashMap collection is ordered

TreeMap class
-------------
It is an implementation of SortedMap interface
SortedMap interface is a child of Map interface
TreeMap collection keeps key-value pair(entry) in the ascending order of key
