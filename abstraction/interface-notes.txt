Interface
---------
Like class, we can define interface
So interface is a structure just like class
Remember class is blueprint of object while interface is blueprint of class
Interface is bydefault abstract
So it can not be instantiated.It means don't try to create object from interface
Methods of interface are bydefault public and abstract
Remember abstract methods of interface can only be public 

Rule:Method body/implementation is not allowed inside interface.It is not allowed till java7(JDK 1.7) but java8(JDK1.8) onwards it is allowed
For implementation of the method you will have to make method either static or default

static void method1()
{
  //body
}
default void method2()
{
  //body
}

Static method inside interface can also be private java9 onwards
