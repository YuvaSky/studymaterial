Abstract class
--------------
Abstract class can not be instantiated
It means object from abstract class can not be created


As we know every object is an instance of a class
So creating object is called instasntiation

Abstract class will always be inherited
It is recommended to make parent class abstract(when you are defining classes in hierarchical manner)

public abstract class AA
{
  //methods
}
public class BB extends AA
{
 //method
}
public class CC extends AA
{
 //method
}
public class DD extends AA
{
 //method
}

Rule:It is mandatory for the child class to override all abstract methods of parent class
