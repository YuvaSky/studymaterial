If type of arugment/parameter of constructor or method is an interface then we will have to pass reference of object of implementation class of that interface

Implementation of interface
----------------------------
A class which implements an interface is known as implementation of that interface.A class can be implementation of multiple interfaces

interface AA
{
  //methods
}
class BB implements AA
{
 //override all methods of interface AA
}

Here class BB is an implementation of interface AA

interface AA
{
  //methods
}
interface BB
{
  //methods
}
class CC implements AA,BB
{
 //override all methods of interface AA and BB
}

Here class CC is an implementation of interface AA as well as BB
